### I am a rock climber and web developer living in the Bay Area, California. I created this website using React, Gatsby + Netlify.

### My passion for rock climbing began in 2001 when I was eight years old. As a youth competition climber, I spent my childhood traveling to competitions and climbing outside. I was the North American Youth Continental Champion in 2002 and a USA Youth National Team Member multiple years in a row. By the age of 12, I had already climbed multiple V9s (7C) outside, a grade very few women were climbing at the time. I am currently focused on training and getting outside to climb.

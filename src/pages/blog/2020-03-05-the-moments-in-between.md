The moments in between, in climbing and life, are the moments that require the most. The most strength, the most focus, the most determination. Transition is a gradual process. In order for the life we desire internally to become our external reality we must brave these moments in between. In these moments sometimes it can feel like no progress is being made. Sometimes everything can feel uncertain. And hard. And even if you fall over and over on a certain move, or continously fail at something in life that your heart is telling you to do, keep pushing. Because these moments help us become the climber or person we need to be to turn our dreams into reality. The energy we insert into these moments dictates our outcome. These moments in between are our flow state. Look internally to continually fine tune and adjust to improve the condition of your flow state. This is where the magic, the beauty, and the change happens.

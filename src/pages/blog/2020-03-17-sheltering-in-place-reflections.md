During these times, I'm thinking of those who do not have access to the resources they need. I'm also thinking about the people who are most at-risk of developing complications if they contract the virus. Even in all of this craziness, my heart is hopeful that humanity will use this experience as an opportunity to understanding each other at a deeper level.

Personally, I had to cancel my trip to France where I was going to climb in Fontainebleau and visit my family who I have not seen in almost 10 years. From my very unique perspective, this has been an interesting experience for me. I feel like I've been 'social distancing' and 'sheltering in place' since I became a single mom at 19 years old. Being an introverted young mom made it especially difficult for me to create relationships in my 20s, or go out and do just about anything besides work. (Which was also difficult because until last year, I was living in Arizona with no family around. If my son was sick and couldn't go to daycare, I missed work.) To me, this is such a strong reminder that there are so many caregivers and people living in poverty who 'shelter in place' everyday as a means of survival. 

Over the last few years I made a promise to myself that no matter what, I would use my situation to become the best person I can be. I've spent countless nights alone after Liam has gone to bed writing, painting, meditating, reading, self-learning, and researching... These years in solitude have provided me with so much clarity and insight on the person I want to be. If I had been surrounded by friends and trips in my 20s, I don't believe I would have been able to nurture such a deep relationship with myself...

I urge everyone who is stuck inside right now to use this time to learn more about YOU. Delve deep inside and have conversations with yourself. This is an amazing opportunity for self discovery and to plant seeds for your future flowers. Sending love and light to all beings.
